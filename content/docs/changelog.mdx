We are excited to announce the initial launch of Animata. Animata is a collection of animations that you can use in your project.

It serves as both inspiration as well as a starting point for your project. You can use the animations as they are or customize them to fit your project. Or simply study them to learn how they were created.

We are still in the early stages of development, so we are looking for feedback from the community. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let us know.
