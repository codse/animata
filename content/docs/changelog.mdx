## June 28, 2024 - Beta Launch ðŸš€

We are excited to announce the beta launch of Animata. Animata is a collection of components that you can use in your project.

It serves as both inspiration as well as a starting point for your project. You can use the components as they are or customize them to fit your project. Or simply study them to learn how they were created. If you are feeling adventurous, you can even [contribute](/docs/contributing) your own components to the collection.

We are still in the early stages of development, so we are looking for feedback from the community. If you have any suggestions or feedback you can let us know by [email](mailto:animata@codse.com?subject=Animata+Feedback) or by [opening an issue](https://github.com/codse/animata/issues).

We hope you enjoy using Animata as much as we enjoyed creating it. Thank you for your support!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
