You don't need to install it as a dependency instead you can simply copy and paste the code, as shadcn/ui, into your project. However, you still need to install the other dependency that the code needs.

## Requirements

1. TailwindCSS

   We use TailwindCSS for styling. See the [TailwindCSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for more information.

2. Framer Motion (Optionally required)

   Some complex animations require Framer Motion. See the [Framer Motion documentation](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) for more information.
