It will create a new file called `expandable.tsx` inside the `components/animata/carousel` directory.

```bash
mkdir -p components/animata/carousel && touch components/animata/carousel/expandable.tsx
```

<Step>Paste the code</Step>

Open the newly created file and paste the following code:

```jsx file=<rootDir>/animata/carousel/expandable.tsx

```
