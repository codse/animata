## Installation

1. Install dependencies.

   This uses [WaveReveal](/docs/text/wave-reveal) for the text. Install it by following the instructions [here](/docs/text/wave-reveal#installation). You can use simple text only if you don't want to use WaveReveal.

2. Create a new file called `expandable.tsx` inside the `components/animata/carousel` directory.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p components/animata/carousel && touch components/animata/carousel/expandable.tsx
   ```

3. Open the newly created file and add the following code:

   ```jsx file=<rootDir>/animata/carousel/expandable.tsx

   ```
