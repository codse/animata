## Core Folders

- `components/`: Contains all the components used across the site.
- `animata/`: Contains all the animations.
- `content/`: Contains the documentation pages.
- `public/`: Contains the static files.
- `app/`: Contains the main Next.js app.
- `templates/`: Contains the templates for the new components.

You will mostly be working in the `animata` and `content/docs` folders while creating new animations and documentation pages.
