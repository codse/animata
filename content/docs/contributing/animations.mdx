## Generating

Once you have the project set up, you can start contributing to Animata.

The first step is to generate a new component. You can use the `yarn animata:new` command to create a new component. This command will ask you the following questions and generate the required files for you.

```mdx
? Enter a name for the new component ›
```

> Simply enter the name of the component you want to create.

```mdx
? Enter the description for the new component ›
```

> Provide a brief description of the component. It will be used in the documentation.

```mdx
? Select the type of component you want to create ›
```

> It will list the available types of components. You can select one of them or create a new type. If you select `+ Create a new type` then it will ask you to enter the name of the new type.

```mdx
? Enter the name for the new type ›
```

> Enter the name of the new type.

If you create a new type, you will see the following message:

```mdx
You need to register the new type in the following file:

config/docs.ts - Add the new entry in docsConfig.sidebarNav
```

Simply open the `config/docs.ts` file and paste the new entry in the `docsConfig.sidebarNav` array.
