## Component Generation

Use `yarn animata:new` for creating new components. This command will add some default files.

## File Naming

All file names should use lower `kebab-case`.

## Image Usage

- Use [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) for images.
- Use [radix icon](https://www.radix-ui.com/icons) or [lucide icon](https://lucide.dev/icons/) for icons.
- If you need specific SVGs, use [svgrepo.com](https://svgrepo.com) and copy the SVG. Make sure to add the credits in the documentation for the icon.

## Imports

All imports should be `absolute`, i.e., use `@animata/...` instead of relative imports like `./` or `../`.

## "use client" Directive

If you are using React hooks, make sure to add the `use client` directive at the top level of your component file.

## Plugins

Install [Tailwind's VSCode plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup) for a better development experience.

## Event Handlers

If you are taking an event handler as a prop, make sure to use the `onXXX` naming convention. For example, if you are passing an onClick event to a button, give it a sensible name like `onLikeButtonPress`.

## Default Props

Make sure to use reasonable defaults in the props. The component should render something by default.

## Conditional Classes

Use `cn` for writing conditional classes. For example:

```tsx
cn({
  'visible': shouldShow,
  'invisible': !shouldShow
});
```

## Responsiveness

Ensure that the components are responsive and look good at different sizes.

## Helper Functions

Move helper functions out of the component. Do not write all the helper logic inside the render function. You can and should move them out of the component.

## Breaking Down Logic

You can break down the logic into smaller hooks/components and compose them. Feel free to create custom hooks and smaller components, but make sure they are all in a single file.

## Opacity and Fractional Properties

You can change the opacity of colors by using the opacity syntax, e.g., `text-green-500/10`. Also, you can use fractional height, width, and position properties like `h-1/2` for 50% height, `w-1/3` for 33% width, `top-1/4` for 25% top, etc.

## Color Usage

Do not use custom colors unless needed. Tailwind already provides a wide range of colors which we can use.

## PR review

Make sure to self-review the PRs thoroughly before submitting them. Check for any linting errors, console logs, and unnecessary code.

## PR description

Add a detailed description of the changes you have made in the PR. It should be clear and concise.

## Labels

If the component requires interaction from user like `hover` or `click` then add the `requires interaction` label to the component followed by `click` or `hover` whichever is applicable in the metadata section.

Available labels:

- `requires interaction` - If the component requires user interaction.
- `click`: If the component requires click interaction.
- `hover`: If the component requires hover interaction.
- `requires config`: If the component requires tailwind configuration to work properly.

For example:

```mdx
---
labels: ["requires interaction", "click"]
---
```
