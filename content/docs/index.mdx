## What is Animata?

Animata is a **free** and **open-source** collection of hand-crafted animations, effects, and interactions that you can seamlessly integrate into your project with a simple copy and paste. The animations are built using TailwindCSS and ReactJS, and can be easily customized to fit your project's design.

We use TailwindCSS for most of the layout, but leave the low-level design details, like colors, font style etc, to you so that you can customize the components to fit your project's design.

## What Animata is not

Animata is not a full-fledged UI library like Material-UI or Chakra-UI. It is a collection of animations and effects that you can use to enhance your project's design. You can use Animata alongside other UI libraries or design systems as well (you will need setup TailwindCSS for this).
